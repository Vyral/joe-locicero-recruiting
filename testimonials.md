<p class="testimonial-text">“I see Joe Locicero as a Next gen leader in the real estate industry because of his ability to see the future big picture of where the real estate industry is heading and make forethinking decisions to gain market advantages even before the industry shifts for his real estate team. His discussions about Next gen lead sources, future team structures and advanced concepts in team management are very insightful and beyond the normal scope of most team leads.”</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">“I’ve known Joe for over a decade and have had the privilege to work alongside him in the mortgage world. When we met, our families were experiencing some hard financial times during the housing crash. Even in the worst of times, Joe always remained client-centric and he maintained a high level of integrity with all of his business. His character never wavered and he always did business the right way.</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">Since the crash, I have watched Joe and his wife, Rose, create a family business in Real Estate that has helped 1000’s of families in our community fulfill their dreams of homeownership. I have also watched Joe’s Real Estate team provide income and opportunities for many agents who were entering the Real Estate industry.</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">It’s easy to say that Joe LoCicero is having a positive impact on our community and industry, but he is also leaving positive footprints in the lives of the many people he crosses paths with every day.”</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">“From the moment I met Joe I sensed that he had a high acumen for the business. One of his key assets is that he asks a lot of questions and genuinely listens to the reply and then adds value and insight into that subject. He is always up on the latest trends and movements in the market and genuinely cares about how he conducts himself and his team in this space. If you're lucky enough to be in the same space as Joe you will always come away with a nugget of info or a strategy that will help your business. He’s also a great guy with a light heart and a quick wit.” </p>

<p class="testimonial-text">“Joe has a dogged determination to keep up with the trends, one can almost say it's a compulsion. Watching the latest technology and seeing if it really makes a difference to enhancing how we run our businesses, following consumers habits based on interest rates and pricing changes, and constantly testing makes Joe a valuable member of our community. A great guy to bounce ideas off!”</p>
